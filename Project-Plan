Project Plan   (last updated: 09/10/2021)

The objective of this application is to display all elements from menu.xml
in a scrollable list, so that any entry may be edited, deleted or moved up
or down, or new entries may be inserted. It uses Yad to provide interactive
display of windows.

Each line in menu.xml is enclosed in pairs of brackets. The framework is:
   Type/Name/Label...End (the actual format can be implied from Type)
   eg:
   <separator label="Internet"/>
   <menu id="root-menu-123456" label="Openbox 3">
      <item label="Firefox">
         <action name="Execute">
            <execute>firefox</execute>
         </action>
      </item>
   </menu>

An array 'OBfile' is used to hold all data throughout the session.

Three files are used:
menu.xml -  The Openbox static menu configuration file (or a test copy);
display.obh -  Records from menu.xml in simplified format for display;
temp.obh -  Used to transfer data to and from the array;

User is presented with a list of entries, and selects a line and an action:
     Edit the element on that line
     Move the element on that line Up
     Move the element on that line Down
     Insert a new element on that line
     Delete the element on that line
     Save
     Quit

Menus
A new menu can be created inside an existing menu.
End markers for menus and items will be added automatically.
A new menu is created with a dummy item inside.

Moving
'Move Up' or 'Move Down' will move the selected element up or down one line.
If an item at the top of a menu is moved up, it will move up out of the menu;
similarly if an item at the bottom of a menu is moved down, it will move down
out of the menu.
The top item of the main menu will not be offered 'Move Up'; similarly, the
bottom item of the main menu will not be offered 'Move Down'.
If a menu header is moved up or down, its contents move with it.
A menu cannot be moved into another menu, but a new menu can be created inside
an existing menu, and items can be moved into it.

Delete
If user chooses 'Delete' a confirmation will be offered.
If the selected line is a menu header, they will also be offered the choice
of deleting the contents as well, or just the header.

1. Copy menu.xml to the array;
2. Copy each header from the array into a display file;
3. Print the display file on screen, with each line indented as desired;
4. Respond to user input as defined above;
